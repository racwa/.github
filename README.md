# RACWA Starter Workflows

This repository contains starter workflows

For more info on starter workflows please see the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization)

Additionally, visit the GitHub [starter workflow repository](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows) for some examples and conventions which will be adopted by this repo.

The workflows contained within `.github/workflow-templates` will show up as options when users go to the `Create Workflow` page (`https://github.com/racwa/<repo>/actions/new`). A nice quick and easy solution to get started with predefined common reusable workflows, and also allow us as an org to curate integrations, checks and other useful tasks.
