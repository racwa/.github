The GitHub named repository necessary for starter workflows

For more info on starter workflows please see the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization)

The workflows contained within `.github/workflow-templates` should show up as options within the `Create Workflow` page (`https://github.com/racwa/<repo>/actions/new`). This will make it a quick and easy option to get started with common reusable workflows and allow us to curate integrations, checks and other useful tasks.
