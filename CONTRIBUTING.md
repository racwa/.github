## Contributing

Starter workflows can be nested within folder under `.github/workflow-templates`. It is suggested that we categorize our starter workflows according to functionality so this repo remains managable.

Ensure that your starter workflow has a valid `.properties.json` sidecar file and is adequately documented.

Useful documentation should also be included at the top of the workflow to provide the consumer with the setup info/guide, prerequisites and relevant confluence or other links.
